						<p>Welcome to the film website, a website made specifically for Gear√≥id Sheehans Spring Boot Project.
						In this website, there is a range of functionality, all to showcase his Spring Boot skills. Any user can
						use the website to view a list of the directors in the database in alphabetical order, select a director 
						from the list to view that director's films, and view a list of the films in the database in chronological 
						order showing all information you have about that film. These users can also register for an account. Authenticated
						users can add a director to the database, add a film providing the film's title, year of release and a director and
						edit the title of a film. Administrators can delete a film and delete a director along with their films.
